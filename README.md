# My Offgrid Controller

 This system is designed to optimize the use of renewable energy in my home by managing the charging of a LiFePo4 battery from excess power generated by a hybrid inverter. When the grid is inactive or the solar input is insufficient, the house switches to off-grid, ensuring energy autonomy and efficiency.

## How It Works

The core of this project lies in the smart utilization of surplus energy. The ESP32 monitors the house consumption and the hybrid inverter production. When the hybrid inverter produces more power than the house demands, the ESP32 starts charing the batteries.
